Query 5: Conclusions.
 After a careful analysis of the data, it can be deduced that the number of authors does not necessarily have an impact on the popularity of a book. For instance, the correlation coefficient between author_count and popularity_score is -0.0196, a reflection of a very weak negative correlation, that is, the number of authors has little to no linear influence on book popularity. Also scatter plots of author_count against popularity_score reveals no clear pattern or trend. And Bar charts showing the average popularity score for different numbers of authors exhibit the lack of significant variation across author counts.
